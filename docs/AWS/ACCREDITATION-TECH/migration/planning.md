## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
Avoid building solution this way where you only discover if there is success at the end.
Instead, start with something basic and gather feedback as you get more complex.


## Migration strategies

Before all, determine one of migrations paths:

- Rehost
  - Automate or do manual (install, config and deploy)
  - Use migration tools
- Replatform
  - Determine new platform
  - Modify underlying infrastructure
  - Use migration Tools
- Refactor
  - Redesign Application/Architecture
  - App code development
  - Full Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) /Software Development LifeCycle (SDLC)
  - Integration

After all, go to validation, transition and production.
