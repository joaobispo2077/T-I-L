# Discovery

Customer-facing discussions fall into three distinct categories, based upon typical milestones in the sales cycle.

Discovery is the information-gathering meeting to help you understand your customer’s challenges.

After all the necessary information is collected that identifies the customer’s goals and pain points, you will meet with the customer again to present your findings and propose one or more AWS solutions. This may actually end up being several meetings, depending on whether tweaks to the solution are needed.

After the customer agrees to a potential solution, you will ask them if they would like to move forward with a proof of concept (POC), where they evaluate the solution in their own environment.

## Preparing for discovery
- Research customer's business.
- Determine market segment.
- Identify industry trends.
- identify customer's competitors.
- Research recent news.
- Research customer relationship to AWS.

Investing time in descovery preparation will help you feel more confident walking into the meeting, and will inspire ideas for questions you can ask.
