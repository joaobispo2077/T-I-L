# Elastic Beanstalk - Advanced

## HTTPS
- Idea: Load the SSL certificate onto the Load Balancer
- Can be done from the Console (EB console, load balancer configuration)
- Can be done from the code: `.ebextensions/securelistener-alb.config`
- SSL Certificate can be provisioned using ACM (AWS Certificate Manager) or CLI
- Must configure a security group rule to allow incoming port 443 (HTTPS port)

### Beanstalk redirect HTTP to HTTPS
- Configure your instances to redirect HTTP to HTTPS/
- OR configure the Application Load Balancer (ALB only) with a rule
- Make sure heal checks are not redirected (so the keep giving 200 OK)

## Web Server vs Worker Environment
- If your application performs tasks that are long to complete, offload these tasks to a dedicated worker environment.
- Decoupling your application into two tiers is common
- Example: processing a vide0, generating a zip file, etc
- You can define periodic tasks in a file cron.yaml

## Custom Platform
- Custmo Platforms are very advanced, they allow to define from scratch:
  - The Operating System (OS)
  - Additional Software
  - Scripts that Beanstalk runs on these platforms
- Use case: app language is incompatible with Beanstalk & doesn√≥t use Docker
- To create your own platform:
  - Define an AMI using Platform.yaml file
  - Build that platform using the packer software (open source tool to create AMIs)
- Custom Platform vs Custom Image (AMI)
  - Custom image is to tweak an existing Beanstalk Platform (Python, Node.js, Java)
  - Custom platform is to create an enterily new Beanstalk Platform
